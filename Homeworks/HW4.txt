In the OrderDetails table, we have the fields UnitPrice and Quantity. Write the query which will return the OrderID, ProductsAmount (amount of products counted by ProductID in each order)  an additional column TotalPrice (containing the sum of values that multiply UnitPrice and Quantity). The result set will contain only data about orders with ProductsAmount of more than 5 and will be ordered by OrderID (ascending) and ProductID (descending).

SELECT OrderID
, COUNT(ProductID) AS ProductsAmount
, SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity) AS TotalPrice
FROM [Order Details]
GROUP BY OrderID
HAVING COUNT(ProductID) > 5
ORDER BY 1, COUNT(ProductID) DESC

Show a list of all the different values in the Customers table for ContactTitles. Also include an amount (count) for each ContactTitle with the alias ContactTitlesAmount. The result set would be ordered by ContactTitlesAmount in descending order.

select ContactTitle 
, count(ContactTitle) as ContactTitlesAmount 
from Customers
group by ContactTitle 
order by count(ContactTitle) desc 

Show the list of the calculated number of orders (AmountOfLateOrders), which were shipped (ShipDate) after the required date (RequiredDate) by employees, which would be represented in the result set with their EmployeeID. Include into the list only rows with the AmountOfLateOrders equals and more than 5.

select EmployeeID  
, count(OrderID) as AmountOfLateOrders
from Orders
where ShippedDate > RequiredDate
group by EmployeeID 
having (count(OrderID)) >= 5
order by 1

Show the FirstName and LastName columns from the Employees table, and then create a new column called FullName, showing FirstName and LastName joined together in one column, with a space in between for those employees, who live in the USA or Germany.

from Employees
where Country = 'USA' or Country = 'Germany'
